# 🛡️ Agent Activity Guidelines

This document outlines the mandatory rules for the AI Agent when interacting with this repository.

## 1. Branch Management
- **Primary Work Branch**: All code modifications, refactoring, and new features MUST be committed to the **`prototype`** branch.
- **Main Branch Protection**:
    - **NEVER** modify, push to, or switch to the `main` branch unless explicitly instructed.
    - **Merge Condition**: Merging `prototype` into `main` is **ONLY** allowed when the user explicitly commands: *"merge p to main"*.

## 2. Documentation & Logging
- **Update Tracking**: Whenever changes are pushed to `prototype`, the update details must be recorded in **`../PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md`** (located in the parent directory).
- **Log Format**: Include the date, brief description of changes, and modified files.
